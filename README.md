# Transformer from Scratch
Implement the Transformer model from scratch and train it on English - Spanish translation task

This repository contains an implementation of a machine translation model based on the revolutionary ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) paper, commonly known as the Transformer architecture. The model is trained to translate English sentences into Spanish sentences using a neural network approach that focuses on self-attention mechanisms.

# Features
- Transformer architecture implemented from scratch in PyTorch.
- The model trained from scratch on [English - Spanish dataset](https://www.manythings.org/anki/spa-eng.zip).
